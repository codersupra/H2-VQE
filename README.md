# H2-VQE
This is a project for comparing the ground state energies of H2 molecule obtained using different quantum computing optimization techniques. I have also added the comparison with the results using classical scipy minimizer. Currently only VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) is used, other optimization techniques will be added in future.
